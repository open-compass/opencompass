## 🛠️ Installation

Below are the steps for quick installation and datasets preparation.

### 💻 Environment Setup

We highly recommend using conda to manage your python environment.

- #### Create your virtual environment

  ```bash
  conda create --name opencompass python=3.10 -y
  conda activate opencompass
  ```

- #### Install OpenCompass via pip

  ```bash
    pip install -U opencompass

    ## Full installation (with support for more datasets)
    # pip install "opencompass[full]"

    ## Environment with model acceleration frameworks
    ## Manage different acceleration frameworks using virtual environments
    ## since they usually have dependency conflicts with each other.
    # pip install "opencompass[lmdeploy]"
    # pip install "opencompass[vllm]"

    ## API evaluation (i.e. Openai, Qwen)
    # pip install "opencompass[api]"
  ```

- #### Install OpenCompass from source

  If you want to use opencompass's latest features, or develop new features, you can also build it from source

  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass opencompass
    cd opencompass
    pip install -e .
    # pip install -e ".[full]"
    # pip install -e ".[vllm]"
  ```

### 📂 Data Preparation

You can choose one for the following method to prepare datasets.

#### Offline Preparation

You can download and extract the datasets with the following commands:

```bash
# Download dataset to data/ folder
wget https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass/releases/download/0.2.2.rc1/OpenCompassData-core-20240207.zip
unzip OpenCompassData-core-20240207.zip
```

#### Automatic Download from OpenCompass

We have supported download datasets automatic from the OpenCompass storage server. You can run the evaluation with extra `--dry-run` to download these datasets.
Currently, the supported datasets are listed in [here](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass/blob/main/opencompass/utils/datasets_info.py#L259). More datasets will be uploaded recently.

#### (Optional) Automatic Download with ModelScope

Also you can use the [ModelScope](www.modelscope.cn) to load the datasets on demand.

Installation:

```bash
pip install modelscope[framework]
export DATASET_SOURCE=ModelScope
```

Then submit the evaluation task without downloading all the data to your local disk. Available datasets include:

```bash
humaneval, triviaqa, commonsenseqa, tydiqa, strategyqa, cmmlu, lambada, piqa, ceval, math, LCSTS, Xsum, winogrande, openbookqa, AGIEval, gsm8k, nq, race, siqa, mbpp, mmlu, hellaswag, ARC, BBH, xstory_cloze, summedits, GAOKAO-BENCH, OCNLI, cmnli
```

Some third-party features, like Humaneval and Llama, may require additional steps to work properly, for detailed steps please refer to the [Installation Guide](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/installation.html).

<p align="right"><a href="#top">🔝Back to top</a></p>

## 🏗️ ️Evaluation

After ensuring that OpenCompass is installed correctly according to the above steps and the datasets are prepared. Now you can start your first evaluation using OpenCompass!

- Your first evaluation with OpenCompass!

  OpenCompass support setting your configs via CLI or a python script. For simple evaluation settings we recommend using CLI, for more complex evaluation, it is suggested using the script way. You can find more example scripts under the configs folder.

  ```bash
  # CLI
  opencompass --models hf_internlm2_5_1_8b_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen

  # Python scripts
  opencompass examples/eval_chat_demo.py
  ```

  You can find more script examples under [examples](./examples) folder.

- API evaluation

  OpenCompass, by its design, does not really discriminate between open-source models and API models. You can evaluate both model types in the same way or even in one settings.

  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY"
  # CLI
  opencompass --models gpt_4o_2024_05_13 --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen

  # Python scripts
  opencompass examples/eval_api_demo.py

  # You can use o1_mini_2024_09_12/o1_preview_2024_09_12  for o1 models, we set max_completion_tokens=8192 as default.
  ```

- Accelerated Evaluation

  Additionally, if you want to use an inference backend other than HuggingFace for accelerated evaluation, such as LMDeploy or vLLM, you can do so with the command below. Please ensure that you have installed the necessary packages for the chosen backend and that your model supports accelerated inference with it. For more information, see the documentation on inference acceleration backends [here](docs/en/advanced_guides/accelerator_intro.md). Below is an example using LMDeploy:

  ```bash
  # CLI
  opencompass --models hf_internlm2_5_1_8b_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen -a lmdeploy

  # Python scripts
  opencompass examples/eval_lmdeploy_demo.py
  ```

- Supported Models

  OpenCompass has predefined configurations for many models and datasets. You can list all available model and dataset configurations using the [tools](./docs/en/tools.md#list-configs).

  ```bash
  # List all configurations
  python tools/list_configs.py
  # List all configurations related to llama and mmlu
  python tools/list_configs.py llama mmlu
  ```

  If the model is not on the list but supported by Huggingface AutoModel class, you can also evaluate it with OpenCompass. You are welcome to contribute to the maintenance of the OpenCompass supported model and dataset lists.

  ```bash
  opencompass --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen --hf-type chat --hf-path internlm/internlm2_5-1_8b-chat
  ```

  If you want to use multiple GPUs to evaluate the model in data parallel, you can use `--max-num-worker`.

  ```bash
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 opencompass --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen --hf-type chat --hf-path internlm/internlm2_5-1_8b-chat --max-num-worker 2
  ```

> \[!TIP\]
>
> `--hf-num-gpus` is used for model parallel(huggingface format), `--max-num-worker` is used for data parallel.

> \[!TIP\]
>
> configuration with `_ppl` is designed for base model typically.
> configuration with `_gen` can be used for both base model and chat model.

Through the command line or configuration files, OpenCompass also supports evaluating APIs or custom models, as well as more diversified evaluation strategies. Please read the [Quick Start](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/quick_start.html) to learn how to run an evaluation task.

**CompassKit** is a powerful collection of evaluation toolkits specifically tailored for Large Language Models and Large Vision-language Models. It provides an extensive set of tools to assess and measure the performance of these complex models effectively. Welcome to try our toolkits for in your research and products.

## ✨ Introduction

![image](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass/assets/22607038/f45fe125-4aed-4f8c-8fe8-df4efb41a8ea)

OpenCompass is a one-stop platform for large model evaluation, aiming to provide a fair, open, and reproducible benchmark for large model evaluation. Its main features include:

- **Comprehensive support for models and datasets**: Pre-support for 20+ HuggingFace and API models, a model evaluation scheme of 70+ datasets with about 400,000 questions, comprehensively evaluating the capabilities of the models in five dimensions.

- **Efficient distributed evaluation**: One line command to implement task division and distributed evaluation, completing the full evaluation of billion-scale models in just a few hours.

- **Diversified evaluation paradigms**: Support for zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought evaluations, combined with standard or dialogue-type prompt templates, to easily stimulate the maximum performance of various models.

- **Modular design with high extensibility**: Want to add new models or datasets, customize an advanced task division strategy, or even support a new cluster management system? Everything about OpenCompass can be easily expanded!

- **Experiment management and reporting mechanism**: Use config files to fully record each experiment, and support real-time reporting of results.

## 📖 Dataset Support

We have supported a statistical list of all datasets that can be used on this platform in the documentation on the OpenCompass website.

You can quickly find the dataset you need from the list through sorting, filtering, and searching functions.

Please refer to the dataset statistics chapter of [official document](https://opencompass.org.cn/doc) for details.
