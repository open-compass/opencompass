Welcome to OpenCompass' documentation!
==========================================

Getting started with OpenCompass
-------------------------------

To help you quickly familiarized with OpenCompass, we recommend you to walk through the following documents in order:

- First read the GetStarted_ section set up the environment, and run a mini experiment.

- Then learn its basic usage through the UserGuides_.

- If you want to tune the prompts, refer to the Prompt_.

- If you want to customize some modules, like adding a new dataset or model, we have provided the AdvancedGuides_.

- There are more handy tools, such as prompt viewer and lark bot reporter, all presented in Tools_.

We always welcome *PRs* and *Issues* for the betterment of OpenCompass.
