During the landing operations on Iwo Jima, Ralph spoke loudly into the radio.
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No
Step-by-step answer:
1.The statement mentions Sally Hemings, who was an enslaved woman in the United States during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
2.However, the mention of watching HBO’s True Detective, which is a modern television show, introduces an anachronism. During Sally Hemings’ time, television did not exist, and the specific mention of watching a specific show like True Detective is clearly out of place for that historical period.
So the answer is (A).
