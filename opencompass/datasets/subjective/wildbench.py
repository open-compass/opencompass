You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of \
the responses generated by AI models.
We will provide you with the user query and an AI-generated responses.
You should first read the user query and the conversation history \
carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of \
the responses based on and rules provided below.

# Conversation between User and AI

## History
<|begin_of_history|>

{history}

<|end_of_history|>

## Current User Query
<|begin_of_query|>

{user_query}

<|end_of_query|>

## AI Response

# Evaluation

## Checklist

<|begin_of_checklist|>

{checklist}

<|end_of_checklist|>

Please use this checklist to guide your evaluation, but do \
not limit your assessment to the checklist.

## Rules

You should compare the above response based on your analysis\
 of the user queries and the conversation history.
You should first write down your analysis and the checklist \
that you used for the evaluation, and then provide your \
assessment according to the checklist.
The scores are in the range of 1~10, where 1 means the \
response is very poor and 10 means the response is perfect.
Here are more detailed criteria for the scores:

- Score 1~2: The response is very poor and does not make sense at all.
- Score 3~4: The response is poor and does help user solve the problem\
 in a meaningful way.
- Score 5~6: The response is fair but has some issues (e.g., factual \
errors, hallucinations, missing key information).
- Score 7~8: The response is good enough but could be improved in some ways.
- Score 9~10: The response is perfect and provides helpful information that\
 can help user solve the problem.

## Output Format
First, please output your analysis for the model response, and then summarize\
 your assessment to two aspects: "strengths" and "weaknesses"; Finally, please\
 write down your rating for the assessment.

Please provide your evaluation results in the following json format by filling\
 in the placeholders in []:
```
{
    "strengths": "[analysis for the strengths of the response]",
    "weaknesses": "[analysis for the weaknesses of the response]",
    "score": "[1~10]"
}

You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the \
responses generated by two AI models.
We will provide you with the user query and a pair of AI-generated \
responses (Response A and Response B).
You should first read the user query and the conversation history \
carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the \
responses based on and rules provided below.

## Checklist

<|begin_of_checklist|>

{checklist}

<|end_of_checklist|>

Please use this checklist to guide your evaluation, but do not limit your \
assessment to the checklist.

## Rules

You should compare the above two responses based on your analysis of the \
user queries and the conversation history.
You should first write down your analysis and the checklist that you used \
for the evaluation, and then provide your assessment according to the \
checklist.
There are five choices to give your final assessment: ["A++", "A+", \
"A=B", "B+", "B++"], which correspond to the following meanings:

- `A++`: Response A is much better than Response B.
- `A+`: Response A is only slightly better than Response B.
- `A=B`: Response A and B are of the same quality. Please use this \
choice sparingly.
- `B+`: Response B is only slightly better than Response A.
- `B++`: Response B is much better than Response A.


## Output Format
First, please output your analysis for each model response, and \
then summarize your assessment to three aspects: "reason A=B", \
"reason A>B", and "reason B>A", and finally make your choice for \
the final assessment.

Please provide your evaluation results in the following json \
format by filling in the placeholders in []:
```
{
    "analysis of A": "[analysis of Response A]",
    "analysis of B": "[analysis of Response B]",
    "reason of A=B": "[where Response A and B perform equally well]",
    "reason of A>B": "[where Response A is better than Response B]",
    "reason of B>A": "[where Response B is better than Response A]",
    "choice": "[A++ or A+ or A=B or B+ or B++]",
