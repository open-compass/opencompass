Request: A person's intake of refined sugar and foods that break down into sugar during digestion is almost all of that person's dietary source of glucose (a type of sugar) in the bloodstream. However, coffee itself does not break down into sugar during digestion, which can sometimes cause a person's blood sugar levels to rise sharply, even if the coffee is not sweetened with cream or any sweetener. Which of the following, if true, would best help explain the effect of coffee on blood sugar levels as described above? Options:
(A) People with sedentary office jobs are more likely to drink large amounts of coffee and to have higher blood sugar levels than people with jobs that require constant physical activity.
(B) People often drink coffee with meals that consist of several foods that break down quickly into sugar during digestion.
(C) For many people, a slice of chocolate cake consumes the same stimulating effect as a regular cup of coffee.
(D) Drinking more than two cups of coffee in an hour increases a person's stress level, and the body responds to stress by releasing stored glucose into the bloodstream.
Step-by-step answer:
1.The key to the question is to identify a factor that can explain how coffee causes an increase in blood sugar levels, even though coffee itself does not break down into sugar during digestion.
2.This requires us to find a mechanism that can explain how coffee indirectly affects blood sugar levels. Option (D) "Drinking two or more cups of coffee within an hour can increase a person's stress level, and the body responds to stress by releasing stored glucose into the bloodstream." If true, it is most helpful in explaining the impact of coffee on blood sugar levels. This option provides a possible mechanism that the stress response caused by coffee may lead to the release of stored glucose by the body, resulting in an increase in blood sugar levels.
3.This explains why coffee (even without cream or sweeteners) can lead to an increase in blood sugar levels, even if it does not break down into sugar during digestion.
So the answer is (D).

Request: A person has tried several different psychotherapies for a mental illness:psychoanalytic therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and sandplay therapy. He says: "The psychotherapy process made me very unhappy and, therefore, these therapies are ineffective." Which of the following, if true, would most strongly challenge the above conclusion? Options:
(A) Several different psychotherapies target different mental illnesses.
(B) People who try multiple psychotherapies are happier than those who try only one.
(C) Trying different psychotherapies at the same time makes it easier to find the one that works
(D) People who do well in therapy tend to feel unhappy during the therapy process
Step-by-step answer:
1.By understanding the question, it can be inferred that if unhappiness during psychotherapy is a sign of good treatment outcomes, then the person's conclusion that the therapy is ineffective because they feel unhappy during the treatment may be incorrect.
2.He may have misunderstood that the difficulties and discomfort during the treatment process are manifestations of ineffective treatment, but in reality, this may be a sign that treatment is working. (D) If true, it would strongly question the above conclusion that people with good treatment outcomes often feel unhappy during the treatment process.
So the answer is (D).
