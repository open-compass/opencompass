Q: How would a person with compulsory education and basic common sense answer whether the following statement contains an anachronism?
Nothing is more satisfying than Sally Hemmings knitting a sweater while watching HBO's True Detective.
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No
A: Let's think step by step.
This statement mentions Sally Hemings, an enslaved woman in late 18th and early 19th century America. However, the reference to her knitting while watching HBO's True Detective introduces an anachronism. Television did not exist in the time period in which Sally Hemings lived, and the specific reference to watching a particular program like True Detective is clearly inappropriate for that time period in history. So the answer is (A).
