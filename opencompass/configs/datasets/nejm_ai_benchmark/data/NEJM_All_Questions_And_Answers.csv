A 50-year-old man is consulting you because of recent diagnosis of a kidney stone. He was in a good state of heath until 1 week ago when he developed sudden and severe right-flank pain. He had no hematuria and no fever. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen without contrast revealed mild left hydroureter with an obstructing 4-mm stone at the left ureterovesical junction.
